        <h2><b>_About Me_</b></h2> <br>
        <p>I am Heshan Randika Karanayaka.I'm 23 years old now and pursuing a degree program at CINEC Campus, a private
          university in Sri Lanka. I am a second-year student studying for my BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering. I didn't
          hesitate to choose this degree program because I have had a passion for the field of computing since I was a
          child and I am interested in the new computer technology in the new world.</p>
  
        <p>In the degree program I am studying, we are taught different modules related to different fields. Among them, I
          I am very eager to learn about the Web Architecture module. Because I am a bit more interested in the emerging field of Web
          Development related to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.These days I am studying the basic level subjects required to
          study that field. The Coursera platform helps me learn those things. I am currently getting the basic
          the knowledge I need through Coursera. The service that comes from it cannot be overstated. I certify that the
          The Coursera platform is an ideal learning environment for anyone.</p>
